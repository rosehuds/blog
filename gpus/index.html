I'm not a 12-year-old, but I am a first year compsci, which is basically the same thing. I have two problems with GPUs. Firstly, I don't understand them. Secondly, I don't know of any 12-year-old-level resources to learn with. Here, I'll try to kill two birds with one stone.</div><hr><div class=prev-next>Previous  |  Next</div></div></div>
