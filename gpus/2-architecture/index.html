There are two ways of doing this.<h3 id=multiprocessing><a aria-label="Anchor link for: multiprocessing"class=anchor-link href=#multiprocessing>#</a> Multiprocessing</h3><p>The most common way is multiprocessing, where there are multiple CPUs within a computer, and code can be run on all of them at the same time. In this case, it's as if there are multiple computers all working on a portion of the task, except the CPUs in a multiprocessing system share resources such as main memory to make communication between them much faster than if they were in separate computers.<p>Writing programs to take advantage of such an architecture is fairly easy because once the task can be split into parts, the development process feels like writing separate programs to handle each part. Sometimes it's the same program that handles every part, in which case you only have to write one program, and life is good.<h3 id=simd><a aria-label="Anchor link for: simd"class=anchor-link href=#simd>#</a> SIMD</h3><p>On the other end of the spectrum, many modern CPUs support a method of processing called SIMD - Single Instruction (stream) Multiple Data (streams). In a CPU with SIMD, there is still only one control flow path. That is, when the CPU reaches some control flow in the program such as an if statement or loop, the CPU either is executing the body or it isn't. Hence, "single instruction stream".<p>Although there can only be one instruction executing at a time, these instructions can perform the same operation on multiple sets of operands simultaneously. A processor that can operate on 8 sets of operands in this way is said to have 8 SIMD lanes. For example, the <code>vmulps</code> instruction from x86 can be used to multiply 8 pairs of numbers, producing 8 results. Each pair is processed independently of the others, and they are processed in parallel.<p>This style of computation is very well suited to a select few applications. For example, to change the volume of a buffer of audio samples, each sample must be multiplied by some scale factor. In this case, SIMD can be used without much thought, and if you're lucky your compiler will transform the na√Øve for loop implementation into machine code that makes use of SIMD instructions. This transformation is called auto-vectorisation, and it can be demonstrated with the following Rust function:<pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust style=background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust><span style=color:#b48ead;>pub fn </span><span style=color:#8fa1b3;>scale</span><span>(</span><span style=color:#bf616a;>buffer</span><span>: &</span><span style=color:#b48ead;>mut</span><span> [</span><span style=color:#b48ead;>f32</span><span>; 8]) {
</span><span>    </span><span style=color:#b48ead;>for</span><span> value in buffer.</span><span style=color:#96b5b4;>iter_mut</span><span>() {
</span><span>        *value *= </span><span style=color:#d08770;>4.0</span><span>;
</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre><p>Compiling with <code>-Ctarget-cpu=haswell</code> to enable AVX2 gives the following assembly:<pre style=background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;><code><span>&LTsimd::scale>:
</span><span>c4 e2 7d 18 05 00 00    vbroadcastss 0x0(%rip),%ymm0
</span><span>00 00
</span><span>c5 fc 59 07             vmulps (%rdi),%ymm0,%ymm0
</span><span>c5 fc 11 07             vmovups %ymm0,(%rdi)
</span><span>c5 f8 77                vzeroupper
</span><span>c3                      ret
</span></code></pre><p>Here we can see only one instruction actually doing any multiplication (<code>vmulps</code>) because this instruction can operate on registers containing 8 values each. Since the function only operates on 8 values, there aren't even any branches in the body.<p>However, auto-vectorisation is really hard, and you kind of have to cross your fingers when compiling if you want to take advantage of it. In GPU land, the processors themselves are structured a little differently, and this makes the parallelism easier for the compiler to take advantage of. It can also make programming these processors easier, as we'll see further down.<h2 id=how-gpus-do-it><a aria-label="Anchor link for: how-gpus-do-it"class=anchor-link href=#how-gpus-do-it>#</a> How GPUs do it</h2><p>Now, we meet something called predication. I don't think many people use this term, and I had to reverse engineer it from some poorly written Wikipedia articles, but the concept was introduced to me fairly clearly in Alyssa Rosenzweig's talk The Occult and the Apple GPU. Thanks to Alyssa not only for the talk but also for responding to my email with a very detailed explanation of how GPU architects are constantly battling each other to redefine words in different ways. We'll meet some of these later.<p>The idea is that SIMD is pretty cool, but since it doesn't allow for diverging control flow across lanes, it's not cool enough. Predication allows each lane in a SIMD-like processor to independently be enabled or disabled, and this can be done using an execution mask, which is a set of bits with one bit per lane; if a bit is zero, its corresponding lane does not write to any registers or memory, so it is effectively doing no work at all.<p>Since we're in GPU land now, as promised, we have some new words to learn. The lanes in a GPU are more powerful than traditional SIMD lanes, so we call them "threads", to indicate that they're cooler and more flexible. The threads come in groups called "wavefronts" or "warps". All threads in a warp share a program counter, meaning threads in a warp cannot execute different instructions at the same time. The execution mask for a 32-thread warp can either be seen as 1 bit per thread, or a single 32-bit mask per warp, depending on which way you look at it.<p>Here's a visual example of divergence in a program running on a hypothetical 4-thread warp. The lines down the side represent whether that thread is enabled at that point in the program.<pre style=background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;><code><span>0 1 2 3
</span><span>| | | |     let mut array = [0, 1, 2, 3];
</span><span>| | | |
</span><span>| | | |     if array[thread_id] % 2 == 0 {
</span><span>|   |           array[thread_id] += 1;
</span><span>|   |       }
</span><span>| | | |
</span><span>| | | |     // at this point the array is [1, 1, 3, 3]
</span></code></pre><p>Because there is only one program counter per warp, if the condition of an if statement evaluates to false in a given thread, that thread has to wait it out by staying disabled until the whole warp gets to the end of the statement. This means that if you have to use an if statement, it's best to keep the body short and/or to have a condition that is usually true, to maximise how many threads are enabled at once.<h3 id=but-why><a aria-label="Anchor link for: but-why"class=anchor-link href=#but-why>#</a> But why?</h3><p>By adding predication to SIMD, we give ourselves the ability to write programs in a way that looks much more like the single-threaded scalar processing that we are all used to. The program from above, written using SIMD, might look like this:<pre class=language-rust data-lang=rust style=background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;><code class=language-rust data-lang=rust><span style=color:#b48ead;>let mut</span><span> array = u32x4::new(</span><span style=color:#d08770;>0</span><span>, </span><span style=color:#d08770;>1</span><span>, </span><span style=color:#d08770;>2</span><span>, </span><span style=color:#d08770;>3</span><span>);
</span><span style=color:#b48ead;>let</span><span> one = u32x4::splat(</span><span style=color:#d08770;>1</span><span>);
</span><span style=color:#b48ead;>let</span><span> mask = (array & one).</span><span style=color:#96b5b4;>eq</span><span>(one);
</span><span>array = mask.</span><span style=color:#96b5b4;>select</span><span>(array, array + </span><span style=color:#d08770;>1</span><span>);
</span></code></pre><p>This differs from the GPU-style program above in one striking way: this program describes calculations in terms of vectors (<code>u32x4</code>, i.e. a group of four integers) whereas the GPU-style code describes the calculations individually, achieving parallelism implicitly by using the <code>thread_id</code> to index into the data, which splits the data into independent chunks. This means that the GPU-style code can be used on any size of array without modifying the code itself.<p>Another important difference is that the GPU-style code looks to me to be far easier to write (and it was), partially due to this scalar/vector code style distinction. Furthermore, the resulting machine code of the SIMD program is probably quite inefficient due to having to save all of the results of <code>array + 1</code> into registers even though it doesn't end up using them. So, SIMD is good for programs that need to do the same thing a bunch of times, but predicated SIMD is good for programs that need to do <em>nearly</em> the same thing a bunch of times, which is way more programs.<h2 id=instruction-sets><a aria-label="Anchor link for: instruction-sets"class=anchor-link href=#instruction-sets>#</a> Instruction sets</h2><p>At the beginning of this post, I asked "what kind of maths can we do on a GPU?". The answer will vary depending on the GPU, so I looked at the manual for AMD's GCN 3 architecture<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#1>1</a></sup>, because I have a GCN 4 card, and apparently they're similar enough that AMD didn't release a new manual.<p>GCN 3 provides all the arithmetic stuff you'd expect; add, sub, mul, div on integers and single-precision floats are there along with some logical operators, but it also has loads of others. There are a few convenient instructions for graphics programming like trig functions, square root, reciprocal square root, and even cubemap helpers. As if we weren't spoiled already, there are some logs and exps as well.<p>Skimming some documents for Apple's G13<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#2>2</a></sup> and Arm's Bifrost<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#3>3</a></sup> instruction sets indicates that most of these instructions are fairly standard.<h2 id=conclusion><a aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusion"class=anchor-link href=#conclusion>#</a> Conclusion</h2><p>CPUs have some ways to achieve parallelism, but they are restricted by the way people expect to be able to write programs for them. GPUs had no such restriction, so their designs can lean into parallelism as much as they want. As we've seen, this leads to an unfamiliar but powerful architecture.<p>In the next few posts, I'll explore writing and running programs on a GPU, and some real-world examples of the architectural concepts we've met so far.<div class=footnote-definition id=1><sup class=footnote-definition-label>1</sup><p><a href=https://developer.amd.com/wordpress/media/2013/12/AMD_GCN3_Instruction_Set_Architecture_rev1.1.pdf>https://developer.amd.com/wordpress/media/2013/12/AMD_GCN3_Instruction_Set_Architecture_rev1.1.pdf</a></div><div class=footnote-definition id=2><sup class=footnote-definition-label>2</sup><p><a href=https://dougallj.github.io/applegpu/docs.html>https://dougallj.github.io/applegpu/docs.html</a></div><div class=footnote-definition id=3><sup class=footnote-definition-label>3</sup><p><a href="https://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/tree/src/panfrost/bifrost/ISA.xml?id=07a5ec83fb09de861d940fea69b49cefb08fda75">https://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/tree/src/panfrost/bifrost/ISA.xml?id=07a5ec83fb09de861d940fea69b49cefb08fda75</a></div><hr><div class=prev-next><a href=https://blog.krx.sh/gpus/1-intro/> Previous</a> ¬†|¬† <a href=https://blog.krx.sh/gpus/3-first-program/>Next</a></div></article></div></div>
